# Web Application Hacking BeEF-XSS — Browser Exploitation Framework


Date: Aug 2025 - Present. 

Project type : Personal

Built an isolated, ethics-first lab demonstrating BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) delivered via XSS to illustrate client-side attack impact, detection, and remediation.

Detailed description (paste into the main description box)
Designed and implemented a safe, internal virtual lab that demonstrates real-world browser exploitation techniques using BeEF and XSS. The lab shows how a tiny injected JavaScript hook can register victim browsers to a C2 dashboard, enabling browser reconnaissance, social-engineering demonstrations, and limited internal network probing — all in an isolated environment with explicit rules of engagement.

## Key highlights:

Developed a reproducible lab topology (Kali attacker VM, Ubuntu victim VMs, Metasploitable/DVWA targets) using VirtualBox host-only networking and VM snapshots to ensure safe testing.

Installed and configured BeEF with secure defaults (changed credentials, bound to internal IP), documented config.yaml settings, and validated hook delivery to victim browsers.

Demonstrated common XSS delivery vectors (stored, reflected, DOM), showed hook registration, and exercised core BeEF modules for recon, social engineering, and network helper tasks — using synthetic data only.

Created step-by-step documentation, remediation checklist (CSP, HttpOnly/SameSite cookies, input validation), and detection guidance for defenders (indicators of hook activity).

Emphasized legal and ethical practices: rules of engagement, snapshots before tests, and no exfiltration of real user data.

## My role / contributions

Lab architect: designed isolated network, VM specs, and safe test targets.

BeEF operator: installed, configured, and operated BeEF; developed safe example hooks and module usage scenarios.

Documentation lead: authored GitHub README, step-by-step lab guide, remediation checklist, and troubleshooting notes.

Security advisor: produced prioritized defensive recommendations for developers and ops teams.

Technologies / tools
Kali Linux, BeEF (beef-xss), VirtualBox, Ubuntu Desktop (victim VMs), Metasploitable2 / DVWA / OWASP Juice Shop, msfvenom (for lab payload examples), Nmap, curl, Bash, YAML (BeEF config).

## Impact / outcomes

Produced a repeatable lab that demonstrates tangible client-side risk to stakeholders and developers.

Delivered actionable remediation guidance that prioritized eliminating XSS, enforcing CSP, and hardening cookies.

Created materials suitable for developer training, red-team demos, and security awareness sessions.

Notes / ethics
Lab and demos are restricted to isolated environments. All tests used synthetic credentials and intentionally vulnerable targets. Do not apply these techniques outside authorized
